FARScore: Molecular Synthetic Accessibility Score based Fragment Assembly autoRegressive Pretraining
Advancing molecular synthesizability prediction through fragment assembly autoregressive pretraining

üöÄ Overview
FARScore revolutionizes molecular synthetic accessibility prediction by leveraging the power of fragment assembly autoregressive pretraining. Unlike traditional approaches that directly learn synthetic accessibility patterns, FARScore first masters the fundamental art of molecular construction‚Äîunderstanding how molecules are assembled from fragments‚Äîbefore applying this knowledge to predict synthetic feasibility.

üß† Core Innovation
Fragment Assembly autoRegressive Learning
The key insight behind FARScore lies in its two-stage learning paradigm:
Stage 1: Fragment Assembly Pretraining
Trains on 9.2 million unlabeled commercially available molecules
Learns intrinsic molecular assembly patterns through autoregressive fragment reconstruction
Captures deep structural and chemical knowledge about how molecules are constructed
Builds a foundation of molecular "construction grammar"
Stage 2: Synthesizability Fine-tuning
Fine-tunes on 800K labeled molecules (balanced dataset: 50% easy, 50% hard to synthesize)
Applies fragment assembly knowledge to synthesizability prediction
Transforms structural understanding into practical synthetic feasibility assessment
This approach mirrors human chemical intuition: experienced chemists first understand how molecules are built before they can assess synthetic difficulty.

üéØ State-of-the-Art Performance
FARScore achieves SOTA performance across comprehensive benchmark evaluations:
Standard Benchmarks:
TS1, TS2, TS3: Superior performance in AUROC, accuracy, and specificity, etc.
Complementary Validation:
TSA (Literature-based): Excels on molecules from actual synthetic routes
TSB (Generated molecules): Demonstrates strong generalization to novel molecular structures

üîß Model Architecture
Built on AttentiveFP (Attentive Fingerprinting), FARScore combines:
Graph neural network representations for molecular structure
Attention mechanisms for fragment-level understanding
Autoregressive learning for sequential assembly patterns

Output: Continuous values (0-1) with threshold 0.5
Close to 0: Difficult to synthesize
Close to 1: Easy to synthesize
